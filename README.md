9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

Setting up and starting debugging in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) involves a few straightforward steps. Here's an outline of how to set up and start debugging a simple program, along with some key debugging features available in VS Code:

Setting Up and Starting Debugging in VS Code

Install Required Extensions:

Before debugging, ensure you have any necessary extensions installed for your programming language or framework. Common ones include Debugger for Chrome, Python, Java, etc. Install them from the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
Open Your Project:

Open VS Code and navigate to your project folder using File > Open Folder... or through the command line.

Create or Open Your Program File:
Open the file containing the code you want to debug.
Configure Launch Configuration:

VS Code uses launch configurations (launch.json) to define how to start debugging.

Press Ctrl+Shift+D (or Cmd+Shift+D on macOS) to open the Debug view in the Side Bar.

Click on the gear icon (⚙️) and select the environment for your program (e.g., Node.js, Python, Chrome, etc.).

VS Code may generate a basic launch.json if it doesn't exist, or you can manually configure it for more advanced setups.
Set Breakpoints:

Navigate to the line of code where you want to start debugging.
Click in the gutter next to the line number or press F9 to set a breakpoint.

Start Debugging:
Press F5 or click the green play button (▶️) in the Debug view to start debugging.

VS Code will launch your program in debug mode and pause execution at the first breakpoint encountered.
Debugging Controls:

Use the debugging controls in the Debug Toolbar (located at the top of the editor) to step through your code:

Continue (F5): Resume execution until the next breakpoint.

Step Over (F10): Execute the current line of code and move to the next line.

Step Into (F11): Move into a function call and continue debugging within that function.

Step Out (Shift+F11): Finish executing the current function and return to the caller.

Restart (Ctrl+Shift+F5): Restart the debugging session.

Stop (Shift+F5): Stop debugging and terminate the program.

Key Debugging Features in VS Code
Variable Inspection: Hover over variables to see their current values or add them to the Watch view.

Call Stack: View the current call stack and navigate to different stack frames during debugging.

Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints with conditions that must be met for the debugger to pause.

Debug Console: Access an interactive console to execute arbitrary code during debugging sessions.

Multi-session Debugging: Debug multiple programs simultaneously using VS Code's multi-session debugging capabilities.

Task Automation: Use tasks and launch configurations to automate common debugging workflows, such as running tests or scripts.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

Initializing a Repository
Open VS Code:
Launch VS Code and open your project folder (File > Open Folder).
Initialize Git Repository:
Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).
Type and select Git: Initialize Repository.
Choose the root folder of your project to initialize Git.

Git add . then git commit -m (pass a messae) then git push

Open the github account and on your and on your page you will se your repository
